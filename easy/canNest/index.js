/*
Create a function that returns true if the first array can be nested inside the second and false otherwise.

arr1 can be nested inside arr2 if:

arr1's min is greater than arr2's min.
arr1's max is less than arr2's max.
Examples
canNest([1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 6]) ➞ true (arr1's min is greater than arr2's min and arr1's max is less than arr2's max)
